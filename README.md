# Proyecto-de-titulo.

This project is presented to comply with the requirements demanded by the University of Bío-Bío in the degree process for the Computer Science Civil Engineering career. The project entitled "Analysis of the capabilities and limitations of Blockchain technology as a tool for the management of institutional certificates" proposes a discussion and analysis of techniques to generate, store and verify institutional certificates through the use of Blockchain technology with the aim of Establish your capabilities and limitations that are currently available.
In the first place, a digital introduction is made of the problem regarding the current use of certificates, specifying what certificates and digital signatures are, as well as essential concepts to understand Blockchain technology in this matter. After the introductory part, alternatives under development that use Blockchain technology to create, store and verify digital certificates are identified and a comparative analysis is carried out based on the advantages that each one has. According to the analysis, the Blockcert application is selected as the most suitable and that offers an open development code where institutional certificates are created, stored and validated in the ethereum or bitcoin blockchain network.
Therefore, the Blockcert application is analyzed, with the purpose of explaining its hashing, anchoring and verification processes, and deepening the various stages that certificates go through to validate their content. And, finally, a prototype is made where the functionality of the application is evaluated in order to create, store and validate institutional certificates at the University of Bío Bío and together with this a cost study is carried out that allows to see the profitability of the proposal
